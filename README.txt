PICK 3 LOTTO
This is a recreation of California's Daily 3 Lottery game using Python and PRNG.
This was created as a portfolio project for my Nucamp Python Fundamentals class.

Ideas/Unimplemented:
- Add a context manager (CM)
- Allow for multiple player profiles using CM and JSON files
- Have changes to player funds be updated in file immediately
- Find a way to reduce game.py main() size/complexity w/ DRY


The PICK 3 LOTTO! AD:
"""
The newest, HOTTEST trend is in!  This reimagining of a game is not only 
familiar to current and former California residents, but also is so very 
close to their fiery hearts. If I were to tell a room of adults, "Raise 
your hand if you dream of becoming the next American millionaire!" The 
only people with their hands down must have their eyes closed too 
(and with a bit of drool sliding down their chin with three big Z's floating away).  
If reading that statement didn't spark something inside of you, then this 
game isn't for you.  If you're not a winner and don't ever want to BE a winner, 
then don't play this game. Trust me, DON'T- your worst nightmares of endless 
riches raining from the skies just might come true...

Introducing: PICK 3 LOTTO!  A game so simple, even a toddler could play it. 
Sorry Timmy, this game is for cool and financially savy adults only.  
The rules are simple.  You wanna win big?  Pick 3 numbers.  
You wanna be the next millionaire?!  Pick 3 numbers!  
You wanna be a young and bold 20-something with no worries or responsibilities??!   
Well, we can't give you that, but we can give you the next best thing: money, 
and lots of it.  Okay, so now you're probably wondering, 
"well how much does it cost to play?" 1 dollar. Or 10. Orrr anything inbetween- 
dollar bills only!  You can play for less than the cost of taking your 
clothes down to the laundrymat on a Sunday afternoon, but you're going to 
have to turn those coins into digital paper first.

You used to have to go to that corner market down the block from you, but 
now you can play from the comfort of your own home, I mean phone.  
Now that you can take anywhere!  Not only that, but you don't even have to wait 
for your winning numbers to come in!  That's right, thanks to randomly generated number 
computer ~magic~*, the winning numbers are chosen the moment you pick yours!  
So what are you waiting for?  Download PICK 3 LOTTO today and start winning!

  *winning numbers are chosen by a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) and are not fully random.
